It should be said that requirement two needs a non-invisible input and 
enter to be pressed for the sorting to take place when running testSort2

ie. 
>testSort2 hello 1 3 2
>*waiting for random key input ie. 'a' and pressing 'enter' key*
>Output is as follows:
>0
>1
>2
>3


Question 1.

#include <stdio.h>

void mySort(int d[], unsigned int n)
{
  	betterSort(d, 0, n-1);
}

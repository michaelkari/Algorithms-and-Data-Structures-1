It should be said that I did not have time to test requirement 2 fully and there may be bugs that I
am unable to work out as I do not have access to a open playTest and playTest2 files through bitVise
at home. However, the core functionality should still be implemented.


1.

#include <stdio.h>

void mySort(int d[], unsigned int n)
{
  	betterSort(d, 0, n-1);
}
